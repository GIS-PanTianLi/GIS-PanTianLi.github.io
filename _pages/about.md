Hi! I am Tianli Pan, a PhD student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Charles W.W. Ng](https://charles-ng.hkust.edu.hk/) and [Prof. Bo Huang](http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/zh/huangbo.html). I currently work in the Areas of Excellence (AoE) Project for establishing a world-leading [Centre for Slope Safety](https://slope-aoe.hkust.edu.hk/), and my role in this project is to utilize both Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and satellite images to develop algorithms for vegetation classification and the landslide detection.  

Education
======
2021.09-present         Ph.D in Civil Engineering, School of Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  
2017.09-2020.06         M.S. in Cartography and Geographical Information Sytem, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University.  
2013.09-2017.06         B.S. in Geographical Infomation Science, College of Earth and Environmental Science, Lanzhou University.

My work and Research
======
Iâ€™m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science with fields like geography and sociology. Methodologically, I am trained as a qualitative geographer, spending a lot of my time in exploring using computer algorithm to understand the both physical and social geography phenomena. My past research experiences involve using DMSP satellite images to provide detailed map of pixel-level population density distribution, calculating river discharge through UAV and multi-spectral satellite images and monitoring landslide with 3D laser. Through my research experiences, I have commanded using qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to process geographical data.
